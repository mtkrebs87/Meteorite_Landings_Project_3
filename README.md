### Project goal   
The Goal is to analyze and visualize the fluctuations in meteorite landings over the past 20 years, 10 years, and today. The focus will be on understanding how the numbers and sizes of meteorites vary across different geolocations worldwide.  

### Interaction    
To interact with the dashboard, simply choose the appropriate year on the drop down selector. With each year change the user will notice that different meteorite locations populate on the map. If the user hovers over a map icon with the mouse pointer, the user will notice meteorite information show on a popup.  

### Ethical Considerations  
The dataset we employed for this project does not have any data that is recognizable as personal data. According to The Meteoritical Society, "A new meteorite shall be named after a geographical locality near to the location of its initial recovery." (1). With that said, although the identity of the person who finds the meteorite could be found, the dataset that we used does not inherently include the finder's information. This means that no personal information is available in our dataset which minimizes the need for ethical considerations in this instance.

### Selection Criteria:  
1.	Name
2.	ID
3.	Year when meteorite was found/fell.
4.	Mass of meteorite
5.	Geolocation

### Potential Questions to answer:  
1.	How many meteorites fallen each year?
2.	How has the frequency of meteorite landings changed from 1983, 1993, 2003, and 2013?
3.	Are there specific geolocations that have experienced a significant increase or decrease in meteorite landings?
4.	Are there any trends or anomalies in the data that stand out during the analysis?
